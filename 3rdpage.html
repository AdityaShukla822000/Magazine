                     Another promising new technology trend is IoT. Many “things” are now being built with WiFi connectivity, 
                     meaning they can be connected to the Internet—and to each other. Hence, the Internet of Things, or IoT. 
                     The Internet of Things is the future, and has already enabled devices, home appliances, cars and much 
                     more to be connected to and exchange data over the Internet. As consumers, we’re already using and benefitting from IoT. 
                     We can lock our doors remotely if we forget to when we leave for work and preheat our ovens on our way home from work, 
                     all while tracking our fitness on our Fitbits. However, businesses also have much to gain now and in the near future. 
                     The IoT can enable better safety, efficiency and decision-making for businesses as data is collected and analyzed. 
                     It can enable predictive maintenance, speed up medical care, improve customer service, and offer benefits we haven’t 
                     even imagined yet. And we’re only in the beginning stages of this new technology trend: 
                     Forecasts suggest that by 2030 around 50 billion of these IoT devices will be in use around the world, 
                     creating a massive web of interconnected devices spanning everything from smartphones to kitchen appliances. 
                     The global spending on the Internet of Things (IoT) is forecast to reach 1.1 trillion U.S. dollars in 2022. 
                     New technologies such as 5G is expected to drive market growth in the coming years.
                     And if you wish to step foot in this trending technology, you will have to learn about Information security, 
                     AI and machine learning fundamentals, networking, hardware interfacing, data analytics, automation, understanding 
                     of embedded systems, and must have device and design knowledge.According to 2018 study, 70–75% of IoT deployments were stuck in the pilot or prototype 
                     stage, unable to reach scale due in part to a lack of business planning. Even though scientists, engineers, and managers across the world are continuously
                     working to create and exploit the benefits of IoT products, there are some flaws in the governance, management and implementation of such projects. 
                     Despite tremendous forward momentum in the field of information and other underlying technologies, IoT still remains a complex area and the problem of 
                     how IoT projects are managed still needs to be addressed. IoT projects must be run differently than simple and traditional IT, manufacturing or construction 
                     projects. Because IoT projects have longer project timelines, a lack of skilled resources and several security/legal issues, there is a need for new and 
                     specifically designed project processes.
