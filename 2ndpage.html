                         Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a 
                         business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, 
                         branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.
                         Business runs on information. The faster it’s received and the more accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that 
                         information because it provides immediate, shared and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed 
                         only by permissioned network members. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more. And because members 
                         share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of a transaction end to end, giving you greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.
                         Operations often waste effort on duplicate record keeping and third-party validations. Record-keeping systems can be vulnerable to fraud and cyberattacks. 
                         Limited transparency can slow data verification. And with the arrival of IoT, transaction volumes have exploded. All of this slows business, 
                         drains the bottom line — and means we need a better way. Enter blockchain.As each transaction occurs, it is recorded as a “block” of data
                         Those transactions show the movement of an asset that can be tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual). The data block can record 
                         the information of your choice: who, what, when, where, how much and even the condition — such as the temperature of a food shipment.
                         Each block is connected to the ones before and after it these blocks form a chain of data as an asset moves from place to place or ownership changes hands. 
                         The blocks confirm the exact time and sequence of transactions, and the blocks link securely together to prevent any block from being altered or a block 
                         being inserted between two existing blocks. Transactions are blocked together in an irreversible chain a blockchain each additional block strengthens 
                         the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain. This renders the blockchain tamper-evident, delivering the key strength of 
                         immutability. This removes the possibility of tampering by a malicious actor — and builds a ledger of transactions you and other network members can trust.

                             Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data. 
                             This is expected to improve response times and save bandwidth. <strong> "A common misconception is that edge and IoT are synonymous. 
                             Edge computing is a topology- and location-sensitive form of distributed computing, while IoT is a use case instantiation of 
                             edge computing."</strong> The term refers to an architecture rather than a specific technology.The origins of edge computing lie in 
                             content distributed network that were created in the late 1990s to serve web and video content from edge servers that were 
                             deployed close to users. In the early 2000s, these networks evolved to host applications and application components at the edge 
                             servers, resulting in the first commercial edge computing services that hosted applications such as dealer locators, shopping 
                             carts, real-time data aggregators, and ad insertion engines. Edge application services reduce the volumes of data that must be
                             moved, the consequent traffic, and the distance that data must travel. That provides lower latency and reduces transmission costs. 
                             Computation offloading for real-time applications, such as facial recognition algorithms, showed considerable improvements in 
                             response times, as demonstrated in early research. Further research showed that using resource-rich machines called cloudlets 
                             near mobile users, which offer services typically found in the cloud, provided improvements in execution time when some of the 
                             tasks are offloaded to the edge node. On the other hand, offloading every task may result in a slowdown due to transfer times 
                             between device and nodes, so depending on the workload, an optimal configuration can be defined.Another use of the architecture is 
                             cloud gaming, where some aspects of a game could run in the cloud, while the rendered video is transferred to lightweight clients 
                             running on devices such as mobile phones, VR glasses, etc. This type of streaming is also known as pixel streaming.
                             Other notable applications include connected cars, autonomous cars, smart cities, Industry 4.0 (smart industry), and home 
                             automation systems.
